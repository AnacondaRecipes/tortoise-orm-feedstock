  summary: Easy async ORM for python, built with relations in mind

  description: |
    Tortoise ORM is an easy-to-use asyncio ORM (Object Relational Mapper)
     inspired by Django. Tortoise ORM was built with relations in mind and
     admiration for the excellent and popular Django ORM. It's engraved in its
     design that you are working not with just tables, you work with relational
     data.
